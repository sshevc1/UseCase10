Hello, you are an expert in C#, .net and xUnit. Can you help me create a unit test for the following function?
        public bool ValidateString(string input, int maxLength)
        {
            string regexPattern = @"^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!""#$%&'()*+,-.\/:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~])[^\s]{1," + maxLength + "}$";
            Regex regex = new Regex(regexPattern);
            return regex.IsMatch(input);
        }

Create automated tests for testing the previously implemented function for the variety of sample inputs and edge cases: too short input, too long input, matching input length, missing uppercase, lowercase, special character, digit, excess whitespace characters in various positions. Make sure to use a testing framework. 
The regular expression should be tested in code on a variety of sample inputs and edge cases (10) to ensure the regex is functioning properly.

---------------------------

Sure, you can use xUnit to write the tests.

First, let's break down the regular expression to understand what it checks:

(?=.*[A-Z]) - Ensures at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*[a-z]) - Ensures at least one lowercase letter.
(?=.*\d) - Ensures at least one digit.
(?=.*[!""#$%&'()*+,-.\/:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~])` - Ensures at least one special character.
[^\s]{1,maxLength} - Ensures the length of the string is between 1 and maxLength and does not contain whitespace.
Below is how you can write your xUnit tests:

using Xunit;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class TestClass
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData("abcABC123!@#", 20, true)]
    [InlineData("abcabc123!@#", 20, false)]
    [InlineData("abcABCabc!@#", 20, false)]
    [InlineData("abcABC123abc", 20, false)]
    [InlineData("abcABC123!@#", 10, false)]
    [InlineData(" ", 20, false)]
    [InlineData("abcABC123!@#", 14, true)]
    [InlineData("abcABC 123!@#", 20, false)]
    [InlineData("aA1!", 4, true)]
    [InlineData("a", 1, false)]
    public void TestValidateString(string input, int maxLength, bool expectedResult)
    {
        // Arrange
        var target = new YourClass();

        // Act
        bool result = target.ValidateString(input, maxLength);

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(expectedResult, result);
    }
}

You would replace YourClass with the class that contains the ValidateString method.

Here's the breakdown of the test cases:

"abcABC123!@#" (length 12) - This is the ideal case where we have uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and the length is within the valid range.
"abcabc123!@#" (length 12) - Missing an uppercase character.
"abcABCabc!@#" (length 12) - Missing a number.
"abcABC123abc" (length 12) - Missing a special character.
"abcABC123!@#" (length 12) with maxLength 10 - This input is too long.
" " (length 1) - This is a whitespace character, which should not be accepted.
"abcABC123!@#" (length 12) with maxLength 14 - The length of the input string is less than the maxLength.
"abcABC 123!@#" (length 13) - This string contains a whitespace character, which should not be accepted.
"aA1!" (length 4) - The minimum valid string (one uppercase letter, one lowercase, one number, and one special character).
"a" (length 1) - The string is too short and does not meet the required conditions.
